1)Makes your program more readable and reduces redundancy(same code again and again)
2)The function is executed when the function is called
3)def functionname(arguments):
4)function call is when a function needs to be executed you write the name of the function with the required arguements in it
5)whatever assigned or defined inside the functions are local scope rest all the variables are said to exist in global scope or in the core memory
6)The memory wipes these local variables and things when the function is done executing so that it has memory to spare
