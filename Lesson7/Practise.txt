1)regex .compile 
2)raw strings are often used while creating regex objects so as to handle backspaces mostly
3)its checks for the given regex expression in the given strings
4)you get the matched strings from mathobject.group() function
5)Group 0 here is the whole number and group 1 is the area code group2 here is the rest of the numbers
6)you would put a backspace in front of it indicating that its not an escape character
7)if     you have compiled doesnt have groups in it it gives you a list of strings if it does happen to have a group it gives you a list of tuples
8)| means pipe it also stands as an and at times
9)? makes the given argument before it an optional often
10) + to be trues needs the arguement before it to be atleast be there once * can be either not there or there multiple times
11){3} only consider the word but {3,5} makes it like a range from which will consider 3 4 5
12)\d stands for digits from 0-9 \w stands for letter or words and \s for space character
13)\D looks for any character which isnt 0-9 \W any charcter that is not a letter or underscore character and \S any charcter that is not a space tab or newline
14).* does a greedy and takes all the words it can find after the given text whereas .*? does a non greedy version of the same
15)re.compile([0-9a-z])
16)while writing the compile statemnt after writing what ur looking for you add ,re.I which makes it case insensitive
17). is used as wildcard character that is it will try matching any character with the given word in it checks and matches
18) It will probably return X drummbers,X pipers,five rings,X hens
19)When you pass re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile(), it allows you to write regular expressions in a more readable and organized manner by ignoring whitespace and adding comments.
20)
21)req=re.compile(r'^[A-Z][a-z]+\s+Watanabe')
22)re.compile('^(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s+(eats|pets|throws)\s+(apples|cats|baseball)', re.I)
